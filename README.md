With more than 4000 different tokens in the cryptosphere, projects are sprouting up all over the place like hotcakes. What token to buy? Which crypto guru to listen to? What call to make? Movement and volatility is the market norm in cryptocurrency. Bitcoin as of the 23rd of May held a thirty-day historical VIX indicator or a measure of the implied volatility of 100 (Bloomberg, 2021). As a point of comparison, this is seven times more than the S&P 500. Some courageous individuals decide to enter the world of money and risks and begin earning but they are instantly confronted with a slew of unseen hindrances. Trading tokens are difficult and the demand for effective social trading products is high. The pressure is on but there’s one project who aims to help us through this slippery slope and COPE with the noise

Cope, which won the community choice prize in the Solana x Serum hackathon which was participated in by more than 3,000 builders and over 100 projects were submitted.  Cope is a token project that intends to solve these problems by targeting three huge user pain points with their product solutions. These pain points can be condensed as the lack of trader weakness evaluations, a concise trading leader board and an automated social trading product for investment. All three represent huge gaps currently available, especially on the Solana blockchain. Of the 16.5 million COPE tokens in circulation, the community holds 90% of them. Combined with the sheer support from backers that have led it to be listed on reputed exchanges like FTX and the Serum DEX, makes Cope a formidable project. Cope has been incorporated into a variety of applications like Blockfolio and Trust wallet. The COPE-USDC pool, established on Raydium to allow individuals to exchange COPE for USDC or stake their COPE for earning farming rewards, has one of the highest liquidity rates on the platform. This represents the sheer demand and strength of the concepts behind Cope’s innovative products.



## **Technology**

The first phase of the COPE project is centred around the ethos of attempting to identify and assess trader weaknesses. These shortcomings will be examined by tracking the accuracy of trading calls. These calls made about crypto markets will provide the data, which can be analysed through the scope of self-analysis. By constantly evaluating their call accuracy, individuals will have to reassess their trading strategies. Simultaneously, the same call data will be utilised for ranking users with the highest call accuracy rates. Cope, and their native COPE token is defined by their tripartite pillars. These pillars are the COPE Leaderboard, the COPE index and the COPE Trading Pools. All three products will be employed using the Solana blockchain and will be intricately consolidated within its comprehensive ecosystem. The COPE Leaderboard will enable the protocol to organize a comprehensive list of the community’s savviest investors. While the COPE index facilitates the community at large to invest in these effective investing minds. And the COPE Trading Pools will permit members of the community to choose call makers with the most impactful and consistent performances. 

### The COPE Leaderboard 

The inspiration behind COPE’s leaderboard stemmed from acutely observing the crypto Twitter community closely. This community holds a vast collection of thousands upon thousands of tweets, given by traders who issue these predictive calls through the years. Through the ups and downs, the hidden gems whose calls are of high quality shine through and garner their deserved attention. This cycle continues to occur in the present and will continue to happen into the future. The team behind COPE believe these valuable insights need to be inspected meticulously and reliably. This data has the potential value in allowing for better decision management.

Individuals will be assessed on-call accuracy, among other key performance metrics. They will be labelled ‘Top Call Makers” and the performance parameters will be quantified into a COPE score for ease in tracking. These scores will be crucial in ranking the top 100 call makers, who will be collated into the COPE index. These top 100 call makers aren’t set in stone and will be subject to “reformation”. This ensures two key factors. Firstly, this keeps competition high and allows for consistency in investment calls. Secondly, it will generate plenty of useful data, which will fuel a new class of investment products. Users who manage to maintain their position on the bi-weekly COPE Leaderboard reformation will be rewarded in COPE tokens. These token emissions will be controlled by the following criteria. The top 100 call makers will be categorized into groups, access a COPE performance zone spectrum every two weeks. These zones will be segregated by COPE score, which begins at a default score of 400 and can go up to a maximum of 1000 as the upper bound.

The COPE score value will be influenced, either positively or negatively, by four distinct factors. The first factor is the size of the call maker's audience. This is expressed as the user’s Twitter following. The second factor is the market’s trading volume delta, which is the total amount of transactions occurring on both the Bid and Ask, over a 24 hour period on the day of the call. Timeframe, which makes up the third factor, will utilise an engine that will project the timeframe the call maker usually uses based on the past history of calls made. The final factor is the ROI, return on investment, the call made based on the classified timeframe, movement and market price delta. This will be measured over the same timeframe identified in the third factor. 

To achieve fairness, this strategy neutralises bias by penalising individuals with a better track record, rather than those with lower COPE scores. This eases the mobility for lower scoring users to move into performance zones and places emphasis on consistency. The COPE Performance Zone placements are based on the following COPE score ranges:

During the bi-weekly COPE Leaderboard reformation, all call makers who at that point in time hold a COPE score of below 300 points will be replaced with new call makers with COPE scores of 400.

###  The COPE Index

Upon achieving a sufficient number of reformations on the COPE Leaderboard, 20 tokens will be appraised to be listed in the COPE Index. The hard cap on the number of tokens for inclusion will be subjected to community reassessment over time. The COPE Index will essentially express market liquidity in a quantitative perspective, combined with the weightage set out by the COPE Leaderboard call makers. The index will constitute both eligibility criteria and Index price calculation. The index will continuously readjust according to the predictions made by call makers. 

The COPE Index will be stringently accounted for using IOSCO’s principles for Financial Benchmarks, which are a set of governing principles to ensure security regulation. The principles are defined by three guiding ethea; protecting investors, ensuring a fair marketplace and the reduction of systemic risk. To be eligible for listing on the index, a token must be required to meet the following four eligibility criteria. The first is meeting the set out average market cap, over the most recent 30 day period. For example, if the market cap established is above $200 Million in the past month, all tokens to be considered have to be worth over that amount. Secondly, the tokens have to meet the set out daily trading volume over the last 30 days to be considered, similar to the first factor. The third is how liquid the tokens are. And finally, whether the token has a USDC trading pair on the Solana Serum Dex, where COPE is intertwined closely with operationally.

 However as time goes by, the community will be given the power to decide if additional exchanges, be it decentralized or centralized can be added for consideration as well. As eligibility criteria are not set in stone and open to continuous improvement, the community will be given autonomy to vote on amending or adding any additional requirements. For example, to achieve a more holistic application, they might decide to include qualitative requirements. The COPE Index will also be subject to rebalancing similar to the COPE Leaderboard, but will occur every few days. This will provide call makers ample time for predictions to occur. 

### Future Products

One of the main products COPE plans to release as a part of its roadmap is an automated investment product. They plan to capitalise on the invaluable data generated from the COPE Index and COPE Leaderboard to formulate a product that will trade on behalf of users. Although COPE will initially be minted on the Solana Blockchain, with consideration for the vast benefits of allowing interoperability, a portion of COPE supply will also be available on the Ethereum Blockchain. This cross-chain interoperability suggests user reports could very well account for trades performed on DEXs that aren’t limited to merely Solana, but Ethereum as well. For example including Uniswap, Sushiswap etc. to be analysed as a pillar of the COPE report. 

While the longer-term vision is to support cross-chain trading, the immediate capability allows for the integration of the Serum DEX which gives the ability for frictionless CLOB trading with active strategies according to rules produced in a smart contract running on the Solana Blockchain. Investors will be able to select one of many active strategies, all of which are making use of the COPE index in determining which assets to buy or sell and which contracts to long/short.

## **Tokenomics**

### COPE Staking & Spending

Currently, COPE can be staked on three main pools; the COPE-USDC Pool on Raydium, COPE-RAY and COPE-SOL. One of the major benefits for users who stake COPE and receive LP-COPE, is the ability for them to unlock a personalised COPE Report. The COPE Report underscores a user's strengths and weaknesses. These are broken down on a call by call basis and explicitly recounts all past call failures. This is especially useful for users to reassess all their trading strategy shortcomings and to brush up the gaps to comprehensively improve their call prediction accuracy. Another key USP is the sheer amount of data the COPE engine will be traversing to generate its reports. These range through thousands of reports and will be able to categorise a myriad of weakness types. It will also have the added advantage of providing advice to allow users to ensure continuous improvement in predicting calls. This will all be built upon a foundation of statistical data. 

### COPE Token Distribution

COPE token distribution is intended to be maintained at a 90%/10% split for Community/ Organisation. For the community, the large majority of the tokens have been previously airdropped to the community. This figure can be quantified as 78.2% of the supply in circulation. The remainder is further segregated into the following verticals;

* Help the World COPE (0.3%): COPE reserved for charitable missions
* Early Contributors (0.8%)
* Liquidity Reserves (2.5%)
* Community Grants (1%)
* Ecosystem (2.2%)
* Pools (5%)

While for organisation, verticals that form part of the organisation will undergo a vesting time lock and will also be categorized under the following verticals;

* Advisors (2%)
* Investors (3%)
* Core Team (5%)

The Tokenomics are illustrated in the clear graphic below.
